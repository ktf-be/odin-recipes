        <h1>Beef Tri-Tip</h1>
        <img src="../img/tritip.jpg" alt="delicious tri-tip">
        <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>I received a food wish for roast beef recently, which can be done with many different cuts. I ended up deciding on beef tri-tip, since it's affordable, flavorful, great for parties, and, using this low-temp roasting technique, nearly fool-proof. </p>
          <p>No marinating, no searing, no nothing; just rub on some salt and spices and pop it into the oven until it reaches the doneness you want. Plate it up with a Romano bean salad or enjoy as a roast beef sandwich!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
